        <p class="fade-in text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-xl 2xl:text-2xl p-2">GAS was founded in 2011 with the goal of making photographic shoots run smoothly.</p>
        <p class="fade-in text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-xl 2xl:text-2xl p-2">It all began when a high-end shoot in LA was brought to a standstill due to an inexperienced team and no broom!</p>
        <p class="fade-in text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-xl 2xl:text-2xl p-2">We decided shoots can’t be run like this and created a business that would ensure this never happened again. We started by buying a van, filling it with useful equipment, and renting it to people who needed it. As shoots have become more complex, we've adapted our services to provide the latest kit, three fully equipped London studios, and guidance to production teams.</p>
        <p class="fade-in text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-xl 2xl:text-2xl p-2">Our mission is to help get jobs done, make clients happy, and make everyone's life easier. That's shooting with GAS.</p>
